Hi there! Here is a quick reference guide to all custom Yarn commands in Friday:

Node Visited
Description: This command returns whether or not a specific node has been visited before.
Use: <<if visited("NodeName") is false>>

startkey and endkey
Description: This command indicates that the following dialogue is key important text. Used for questioning purposes.
Use:<<startkey Journal keytext1>>
	NPC: Hey, this is important text.
	<<endkey Journal>>

Start Questioning
Description: This command tells the journal to transition to the questioning state, opening up the question panel on top.
Use: <<startquestioning Journal>> //Before you start question dialogue
	 <<stopquestioning Journal>> //Exit questioning and return to normal journal layout.

Ask Question
Description: This command passes in two strings and returns a bool. Each string is the key identifier string corresponding to the dialogue wanted. If the second string is "", the function will only test for the first parameter. Returns if the question was right or not.
Use: <<if question("keytext1", "keytext2") is true>>
or - <<if question("keytext1", "") is true>>
