Abby Dialogue:
	friday_alone
		- ABBY: That’s what I’m saying! Friday was alone!
	locked_door
		- ABBY: Yeah! I locked the door when I left, just like I always do.
		- ABBY: I had to unlock it again.
	gang_violence
		- NEWCASTER: Initial reports seem to connect the incident to a string of gang violence common in the area.
		- ABBY:  Shame that the neighborhood has gotten so bad lately. It all seems so senseless.
	abby_work
		- ABBY: It’s not that uncommon in my line of work. Best to separate your personal and private lives, right?
	raised_rent
		- ABBY: He raised the rent for all the tenants because of all the gang violence scaring people out. Total crap.
	spare_money
		- ABBY: Look around, Detective. This isn’t exactly the best place. If we had enough money to spare for crimes, we wouldn’t be living here.
	mail
		- ABBY: Found her right in the middle of the room. I left her by herself to go get my mail, and… yeah.
	locked_patio
		- ABBY: Huh? Well, we have patios, as you can see, but I keep mine locked up tight.
		- ABBY: They’d need a key if they wanted to enter from the back, but I suppose it’s possible.
Leonard Dialogue:
	bill_fin
		- ABBY: The weirdest part are the crimes themselves. A lot of assaults, random locals being accosted, but not a lot of muggings. Bill Finn said he’d clean it up when he got elected, but nothing’s changed. (Abby's Room)
		- TV REPORTER: Governor Bill Finn has signed a new beautification bill into law today. (Tristan's Room)
		- TRISTAN: And Friday never trusted that Bill Finn character. (Tristan's Room)
		- BERNARD: I guess Bill Finn is doing a good thing with it, but if he would focus on cleaning up crime instead of planting more flowers, I would have a lot less late meetings right now. (Bernard's Room)
