Dialogue:
friday_alone
	- ABBY: That’s what I’m saying! Friday was alone!
locked_door
	- ABBY: Yeah! I locked the door when I left, just like I always do.
	- ABBY: I had to unlock it again.
gang_violence
	- NEWCASTER: Initial reports seem to connect the incident to a string of gang violence common in the area.
	- ABBY:  Shame that the neighborhood has gotten so bad lately. It all seems so senseless.
abby_work
	- ABBY: It’s not that uncommon in my line of work. Best to separate your personal and private lives, right?
raised_rent
	- ABBY: He raised the rent for all the tenants because of all the gang violence scaring people out. Total crap.
spare_money
	- ABBY: Look around, Detective. This isn’t exactly the best place. If we had enough money to spare for crimes, we wouldn’t be living here.
mail
	- ABBY: Found her right in the middle of the room. I left her by herself to go get my mail, and… yeah.
locked_patio
	- ABBY: Huh? Well, we have patios, as you can see, but I keep mine locked up tight.
	- ABBY: They’d need a key if they wanted to enter from the back, but I suppose it’s possible.
